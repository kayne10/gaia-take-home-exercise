# Gaia Take Home Exercise

## Overview

The objective of this repo is to provide the scripts of how I can quickly approach typical problems of a real world data sample. I also demonstrate how I would find insights within this data. This exercise is a high-level interpretation of how I would approach these problems.

## Prerequisites
- Python3
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

The `scripts` directory contains the code for problems 1 and 2. I did not have enough time to create a script for problem 3. However, I explain my step by step approach on how I would implement a data model.

The `images` directory contains a few data visualizations.
